    "## Preparing stellar population models for **paintbox**\n",
    "Paintbox was initially designed to describe the observed spectrum, i.e., the flux from stars as a function of the wavelength, of galaxies where stars are not individually resolved. In these cases, the most important ingredient to describe the stellar features in observations are stellar population models, which describe the properties of an emsemble of stars with different properties, e.g., ages, metallicities, etc. These models are incredibly complex to be generated, but several groups of astronomers distribute their models for free for users, either publicily or under request. However, there is no single standard way of distributing stellar population models, so we have to prepare the data from the models *before* using **paintbox**. Moreover, in practical applications, we also require the models to be optimized for that application, as a way to minimize the (often expensive) number of computations depending on the resolution of the data.

    "### Using MILES stellar populations\n",
    "\n",
    "Stellar populations models from the MILES library can be obtained in a variety of ways in their [website](http://research.iac.es/proyecto/miles//pages/stellar-libraries/miles-library.php). For this example, we will use a set of single stellar population (SSP) templates of the E-MILES models produced with BASTI isochrones and assuming a Chabrier initial mass function, which can be downloaded in a tarball from this [link](ftp://milespublic:phoShi4v@ftp.iac.es/E-MILES/EMILES_BASTI_BASE_CH_FITS.tar.gz) (95 Mb). After downloading the data, it is necessary to unpack the tarfile (preferentially into a directory), which contains 636 SSP spectra. "
