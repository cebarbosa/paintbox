Similar to the MILES models, CvD are also distributed as SSP models with varying ages, metallicities, and IMFs, but also provide response functions that allow the variation of several individual elements, e.g.,  C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe. Below we show how to handle these models using **paintbox** utilities. For this example, we use the SSP models computed with the [VCJ stellar library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJS..230...23V/abstract) version 8, and the response functions from Conroy et al. (2018) version 3."
